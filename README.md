# Carousel

Simple slider made for The Odin Project.

"This strip of images can then move behind the picture frame,
showing a different image depending on what part of the strip is visible."
I couldn't figure out how to do it with HTML and CSS, so I based slider functionality on JavaScript.

Not really responsive.
